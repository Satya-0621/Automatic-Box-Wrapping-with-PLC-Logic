The Automatic Box Wrapping System using PLC automates the packaging process by efficiently wrapping boxes with plastic film. It consists of sensors, a motorized turntable, a film dispenser, and a PLC-controlled actuator. The PLC manages the wrapping sequence, speed control, and safety interlocks, ensuring precise operation. An HMI interface allows users to set parameters like rotation speed and wrap count. This system enhances packaging speed, reduces labor, minimizes film wastage, and ensures uniform wrapping quality. Widely used in logistics, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals, it improves efficiency, reduces errors, and provides a cost-effective solution for industrial packaging automation
